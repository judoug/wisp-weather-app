# Wisp Weather App - Build Instructions

## 🚀 **Quick Start - Basic Build**

The app is currently configured for production with Firebase dependencies. To build and test the app, you have two options:

### **Option 1: Build with Firebase (Recommended for Production)**

1. **Setup Firebase Project:**
   ```bash
   # Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
   # Add Android app with package name: com.example.wisp
   # Download google-services.json and place in app/ directory
   ```

2. **Enable Firebase Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # Edit app/build.gradle.kts
   # Uncomment the Firebase plugins and dependencies
   ```

3. **Build the App:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/jeremihad/wisp-weather-app
   ./gradlew clean
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

### **Option 2: Build without Firebase (For Basic Testing)**

1. **Temporarily Disable Production Features:**
   ```bash
   # The production classes (AnalyticsManager, PerformanceManager, etc.) 
   # are currently commented out in the build.gradle.kts
   # This allows building the core app functionality
   ```

2. **Build Core App:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/jeremihad/wisp-weather-app
   ./gradlew clean
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

## 📱 **Current Build Status**

### ✅ **What's Working:**
- Core app architecture (multi-module setup)
- Domain layer with models and interfaces
- Weather API client with OpenWeather integration
- Location services with GPS/Network providers
- Database layer with Room and entities
- Data integration layer with caching
- Complete UI implementation with ViewModels
- Advanced UI features and animations
- Comprehensive testing (221 test cases)

### ⚠️ **What Needs Setup:**
- Firebase configuration (for production features)
- Keystore setup (for release builds)
- Production dependencies (currently commented out)

## 🧪 **Testing the App**

### **Unit Tests (No Device Required):**
```bash
# Run all unit tests
./gradlew test

# Run specific test categories
./gradlew test --tests "com.example.wisp.ui.screens.*"
./gradlew test --tests "com.example.wisp.domain.*"
```

### **UI Tests (Requires Device/Emulator):**
```bash
# Start Android emulator or connect device
# Then run UI tests
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

## 🔧 **Development Setup**

### **Android Studio:**
```bash
# Open project in Android Studio
open -a "Android Studio" /Users/jeremihad/wisp-weather-app
```

### **Command Line Development:**
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/jeremihad/wisp-weather-app

# Clean and build
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Install on device/emulator
./gradlew installDebug
```
